  <h1>
      For DMs
  </h1>
  <p>
    This page is especially for all the DMs out there. What is a DM?! I hear you ask. A DM, or Dungeon Master, is the leader of the game. The storyteller,
    if you will.
  </p>
  <p>
    "You wake up, blurry eyed, and see nothing but solid stone all around you, with a forboding metal door at one end of what you deem to be a prison
    cell. Your belongings have vanished, you have nothing but the clothes on your backs. A candle flickers in the corridor a few yards from the door.
    What do you want to?"
  </p>
  <p>
    The DM is responsible for mediating the story; controlling characters the players may encounter; and keeping an eye on the rules. Each DM is different
    and play to a different stle, but here are some basic rules and tips for new DMs to follow:
  </p>

  <h3>
    DM tips
  </h3>

  <ol>
    <li><span class='bold'> Go with the flow.</span><br> D&D is meant to be fun for everyone, and for most, getting hung up on the exact weight a mule can
      carry, or precicely what shape a shapshifter can take isn't that fun. You don't need to memorise the rule book, or refer to it at every turn. Use
      it more as a guide and use your instinct and judgement for the rest.
    </li>
    <li><span class='bold'> Don't over prepare.</span><br> You never know how a game is going to go, or what your players are going to do. No matter how
      well crafted the story you laid out in the town was, your players might just decide to ignore it all and go off into the forest instead. And
      that's ok. Don't waste time creating a very specific storyline that may well go to waste, instead, design characters and plots that can be used
      anywhere
    </li>
    <li><span class='bold'> Don't under prepare.</span><br> An experienced DM will be able to think on their feet and adlib a story, but it usually pays
      to have a rough idea of things that could happen. Who may your players meet? What sort of places are nearby? What encounters could happen? It's
      useful to have these little bits of information up your sleave so the story doesn't seem rushed or forced.
    </li>
    <li><span class='bold'> Acting Darling.</span><br> Immersion is important. It varies between groups and between players, but often immersion can
      lead to a more in depth and enjoyable experience. Use voices, minatures, costumes, anything you want to help bring the story to life. Tankards
      instead of glasses, capes, candles, they can all add to the experience and draw your players into the game.
    </li>
  </ol>
