      Welcome Traveller
  </h1>
  <p>
      We begin our adventure in the Crow's Foot, a dingy tavern in the village of Coalfell. A misfit party of gonmes, elves and orcs,
       you prepare to embark on the journey of a lifetime, facing sights as yet unseen and terrors as yet untold. Goblins, wizards, dungeons and even
       dragons await you, all you need to do is pick up your sword and roll for initiative!

    itterations, the most often played are the 3.5 and 5th editions. Each version uses slightly different mechanics, but at their cores, they are the
    same game the has been drawing together communities and forging friendships for decades. D&D can be anything you want it to be, and lets you be
    anything <span class='italic'>you</span> want to be from a heroic knight fresh from the battle field or a conman living a life of crime to a royal living
    in the lap of luxary.
