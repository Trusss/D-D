# DND101
 
 The idea of this website was to explain the general concepts and premises behing Dungeons and Dragons (D&D). 
 Pages to explain characters, leading the game and general game play. 
 There wasn't really a need to add social media buttons, as it isn't a personal site or a business, although going forward I'd want to add some with links to sites with further information, like those made by the creators of the game. 
Additionally, I'd like to add more interactive features to the site, perhaps imbedding instructional videos etc. 

 I didn't use any bootstrap, but I'd be interested to play around with it to see what I could add.
 
  One thing I'd particularly like on my site is something similar to the dice roller I linked. It's all well and good linking to a separate site, but fae more useful for it to be imbedded in the site. I'd do this either by imbedding a premad one, or possibly see if I could make it from scratch with C or another language.
